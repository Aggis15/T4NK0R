# Welcome to the T4NK0R repository!

This is a personal bot that is used in a server of a good friend of mines. 

## What does this bot do?

Well, it's a bot that can be used to do a lot of things. Levels, music and more! This started as a simple project to learn Python but has evolved quite a bit over the past year.

## Can I host this myself?

Since this was not made for using outside of the original server, personal hosting might not be possible. If you insist on using this bot for your own server, open an issue and I'll help you out.

## This seems so cool! Can I contribute?

Sure! The [Trello](https://trello.com/b/HxDSanm5/t4nk0r) board is where you can find all the tasks that need to be done. Feel free to open a PR or issue if you have something to contribute.

### Thanks for checking the repository out!
